# ClimateCalc
ClimateCalc is a tool designed to help users estimate their carbon footprint related to transportation. It can be used by individuals, organizations, and researchers to assess the impact of their transportation-related activities on the environment.

# How to use:

To use ClimateCalc, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. Once you have Python installed, you can download the code from the GitHub repository. The repository contains a script file named "traffic_analysis.py". You can run this script in the command prompt or terminal to start the program.

Once you run the script, you will be prompted to input parameters related to your transportation activities. These parameter include:

Distance traveled: You will need to provide the distance traveled in miles or kilometers. The calculator will use this distance to estimate the amount of fuel consumed and the resulting carbon emissions.

Mode of transportation: You will need to specify the mode of transportation used. The calculator supports various modes of transportation, including cars and buses.

Fuel type: You will need to specify the type of fuel used, such as gasoline, diesel, or biofuel.

Once you have provided all the required information, the calculator will estimate the carbon emissions resulting from your transportation activities. It will also provide recommendations for reducing your carbon footprint, such as using public transportation or carpooling.

# Code explanation:

The traffic_analysis.py script is written in Python and consists of several functions that perform specific tasks. The main function is called "calculate_carbon_emissions". This function takes various parameters as input and returns the estimated carbon emissions based on the data found in a CSV file named "traffic_data.csv"

The script uses pandas to read data from a CSV file containing information about different vehicle types and their fuel efficiency. The script also uses the argparse library to parse command-line arguments.
